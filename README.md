# Snake Game with Perceptron AI

This project implements the classic "Snake" game using a Perceptron algorithm to develop artificial intelligence that controls the snake. The idea is to create a snake that can improve its skills through learning across several generations.

## Features

- **Classic Snake Game**: Enjoy the traditional gameplay of the Snake game where the objective is to eat apples and grow the snake.
- **AI-Controlled Snake**: The snake is controlled by an AI using a Perceptron algorithm, learning and improving over multiple generations.
- **Generational Learning**: The AI gets better at playing the game through continuous learning from previous generations.
- **User Interface**: A simple and intuitive user interface using Java Swing components.
- **Real-Time Display**: Watch the AI-controlled snake in real-time as it navigates and learns within the game environment.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game-perceptron.git`.
2. **Compile the Code**: Compile the Java files using your preferred IDE or command line tools.
3. **Run the Game**: Execute the `SnakeGame` class to start the game. Watch as the AI-controlled snake begins to play and improve over time.

## Project Structure

- `Apple.java`: Handles the generation and placement of apples within the game grid.
- `Brain.java`: Contains the Perceptron algorithm for AI learning.
- `Brain2.java`: A secondary implementation or variation of the Perceptron algorithm.
- `Directions.java`: Manages the direction states of the snake.
- `GameFrame.java`: The main frame of the game window.
- `GamePanel.java`: The panel where the game is rendered and played.
- `NewGeneration.java`: Manages the creation of new generations of the AI-controlled snake.
- `Snake.java`: Defines the snake, its movement, and growth behavior.
- `SnakeGame.java`: The main class that sets up and starts the game.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Java Swing for the graphical user interface.
- **Backend**: Java for game logic and AI implementation.
